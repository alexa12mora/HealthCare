## Environment

Navigate to the `HealthCare` folder  

Create a virtual environment using conda Windows/Linux:   
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Then activate the environment using:  
`conda activate hc_env`   

Then run this command
`conda env update -f environment.yml`  
This command can be executed in case there are changes in the environment.yml and thus update the environment without having to create it again
